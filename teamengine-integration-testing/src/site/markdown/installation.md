 - Navigate to  teamengine-inregration-script
         
          $ cd teamengine-inregration-script 
  
 - Now go to teamengine-integration-testing -> src -> site -> resources -> script -> jmeter from here copy all the folder's(like csw202,gml32,kml22 .....etc) and paste them all into teamengine-inregration-script(directory created by you)

 - Copy index.html and test.properties from teamengine-integration-testing -> src -> site -> resources -> script and paste it to teamengine-inregration-script
 
          $ cp teamengine-integration-testing/src/site/resources/script/index.html teamengine-inregration-script
          $ cp teamengine-integration-testing/src/site/resources/script/test.properties teamengine-inregration-script
       
 - After completing all the above steps, directory structure should be like..

         teamengine-integration-script
                    |-- csw202
                    |-- gml32

                    |-- wms13
                    |-- run-test.sh (shell-script file)
                    |-- teamenginePlan.jmx
